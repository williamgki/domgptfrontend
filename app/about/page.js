            <p className="mb-4">
              I live in the UK, have a family, and have worked in finance, as an entrepreneur 
              and in artificial intelligence. I&apos;m not keen on sharing more info - for the reasons 
              best given by Gwern <a href="https://gwern.net/me" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not affiliated with Dominic Cummings and have never met him. If you are him, 
              please email (domgptlarp at Google&apos;s email service)- I&apos;m keen to clear up any IP issues / donate to Maths Circles / whatever.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is next?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The site is based on Cummings&apos; blog posts. I&apos;m keen to incorporate his tweets 
              and podcast / youtube interviews. These cost money directly and time through 
              opportunity costs. If I get a reasonable number of coffees then I&apos;ll implement 
              them in the next few weeks. Including these materials would improve the quality 
              of the output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Longer term I&apos;d also be interested in making similar sites for other figures. 
              Recently I have been thinking about Michael Nielsen and Stafford Beer.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How is the site made?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The idea for this site is mine, but the tools recommended below (as well as all 
              the code) came from Claude. I have no technical ability. It was partly inspired 
              by a <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/how-to-read-a-book-using-o1.html" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> from 
              Tyler Cowen: we should be shifting to a more question-lead paradigm of learning.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">The full stack is:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Pinecone and Cohere worked together to encapsulate and represent Dom&apos;s thoughts 
                  in a way which can be read by computers.</li>
              <li>GitHub is a kind of exercise book used by me and Claude to communicate with 
                  Railway and Vercel below.</li>
              <li>Railway does the heavy lifting - &apos;backend&apos;, while Vercel does the presentation 
                  - &apos;frontend&apos;.</li>
              <li>Claude takes the references generated by Pinecone and Cohere and presents it 
                  back to you the user.</li>
              <li>Grok / Aurora generated the background images.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              I&apos;d be open to making other pages  if you want a similar site made about you 
              or someone you think highly of. An ethical screen exists (&apos;No&apos; to Greta or Andrew Tate).
